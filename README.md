## Why?

You've had small tasks you wanted to do in the near future. You occasionally forgot to do one. Sometimes it was too minor to be committed to memory. Sometimes you came up with it in bed just before falling asleep and it was gone by the next morning. You could've opened up your calendar app and set up an event, but do you really need such a formal process to remember to fire up the oven when you get home? 

RemindMe provides a solution to that niche problem. It isn't a heavy-duty scheduling app where you set an exact date, time, location, description, filling your reminder with tiny tasks. You just set a relative time for when you want to be reminded of something, and you're good to go.

Reply to that email in half an hour when you can focus on it, schedule that appointment when you get home in the evening, remind yourself to check that sale when you get back on your computer tomorrow morning.
